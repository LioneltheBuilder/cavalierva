# Pallet Management System

## Introduction
The Pallet Management System was born out of a practical need at Cavalier, a distribution company where the traditional method of tracking customer orders involved a clipboard and paper to manage inventory on high shelves. This process was not only time-consuming but also inefficient, requiring staff to physically climb and check each pallet's small print labels. Recognizing the need for a more streamlined approach, I developed this web-based application, allowing users to easily manage and assign pallet spaces from the ground. Now, with just a few clicks, staff can select a shelf, enter a customer's name, and efficiently track orders, all without the need to climb up and down. This system not only saves time but significantly enhances operational efficiency, providing a clear, quick, and modern solution to pallet management.

## Features
1. Easy Space Selection: Utilize a user-friendly dropdown menu to effortlessly select any pallet space within two rows (e.g., 1a-1i, 2a-2i). This feature allows for quick identification and assignment of spaces for order storage.

2. Efficient Customer Assignment: Assign customer names to specific pallet spaces with ease. This feature replaces the cumbersome process of manual labeling, significantly streamlining order management.

3. Real-Time Updates: The system is designed to provide real-time updates, so the status of each space is immediately known. This ensures an up-to-date overview of space utilization and customer order placement.

4. Delete or Replace Functionality: Offers the ability to quickly delete or replace customer names associated with each pallet space. This flexibility is crucial for adapting to changes in order fulfillment and inventory management.

5. Enhanced Operational Efficiency: By digitizing the process of tracking pallet spaces, the system dramatically reduces the time and physical effort previously required, leading to a more efficient and less labor-intensive operation.

6. Standalone Web Application: As a web-based application, it requires no special software installation and can be accessed from any device with a web browser, ensuring ease of use and accessibility.

7. Scalable and Customizable: Designed with scalability in mind, the system can be adapted and expanded to meet the growing needs of your business. Additionally, it offers options for customization to align with specific operational workflows and branding.



## Technologies Used
This project was built using a variety of modern technologies and tools, ensuring efficiency, reliability, and ease of use:

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js was used for server-side logic, providing a fast and scalable backend.

Express.js: This minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework was employed to handle HTTP requests and simplify routing and middleware integration.

Sequelize ORM: Sequelize, a promise-based Node.js ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), was used for database management, allowing for robust and flexible interaction with the SQLite database.

SQLite: A lightweight, file-based database engine. SQLite was chosen for its simplicity and ease of setup, providing a reliable storage solution for the application's data.

Pug (formerly Jade): A high-performance template engine heavily influenced by Haml and implemented with JavaScript for Node.js, Pug was used to create clean and readable HTML.

CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) were utilized for styling and layout of the web interface, ensuring an engaging and responsive user experience.

JavaScript: The client-side logic and interactivity were built using JavaScript, enhancing the application's functionality and user interface.

Git: Used for version control, Git allows for efficient tracking of changes and collaboration.
